	<img src="TU_Tower.jpg" alt= Trinity Tower" width="400" height="300"><br>Photo courtesy of Trinity University</div> </p> <p> Trinity is a small college campus in a big Texas city! Trinity offers a wide variety of majors and minors for every student's interest. There is also a number of ways to get involved on campus through sports, clubs, government positions and more! The layout of the campus makes it easy to get from your dorm to classes and other buildings with a short walk.  </p> 
	<p> The features about Trinity that I appreciate are: <br> 1. The ability to be a student athlete because of the strong academic and athletic programs. <br> 2. The smaller size of the school make Trinity feel more like home because I see familiar faces everyday. <br> 3. The professors are personable and genuinely want every student to suceed. </p>
	<p> I chose Trinity University because of the "small school in a big city" feel as well as its proximity to my home town. Since I play volleyball, it was important to me that my parents be able to come to home games fairly easily. I also wanted to go to a school with strong academics in order to get the best teaching for my degree. Lastly, Trinity offers so many special opportunities that other schools do not, like study abroad, internship and job search help, and research projects. </p>
	<p>I hope to major in mathematics finance and minor in sports management. It is the perfect combination of my strength in math as well as my passion for sports. My dream is to one day work in the financial branch of a sports franchise. Here are some links to important information about my chosen interest:
